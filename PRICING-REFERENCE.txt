COMMON CLIENT QUESTIONS & ANSWERS:
==================================

Q: "Can I pay less if I only need 5 pages instead of 8?"
A: No, the Professional Package is $1,200 regardless of page count (5 pages = same price as 8 pages). It's package pricing, not per-page pricing. If you only need 3-4 pages, the Starter Package ($800) might be better.

Q: "What's included in free support?"
A: Text changes, image swaps, bug fixes, and basic technical help. These stay free forever. Adding new pages ($125) or custom features ($150+) cost extra even during the free support period.

Q: "Do you build online stores?"
A: I don't specialize in e-commerce right now. I focus on informational websites that showcase businesses and services.

Q: "How long does a project take?"
A: Starter Package: 1-2 weeks, Professional Package: 2-3 weeks from deposit to launch.

Q: "What if I need changes after launch?"
A: Small updates (text, images) remain free forever. New pages or custom features require additional payment.

Q: "Can you help with domain setup?"
A: Yes, I provide guidance and can help configure DNS settings, but you purchase and own the domain.
